# Simulation-Design
Simulation accomplished by CPP

### Taks One: 

To develop a Monte Carlo simulation that simulates the occurrence of chip defects in the CPU chip manufacturing process. 

__Wafer specification:__
* 12 cm diameter wafer
* 
* Chip sizes to be studied: 1x1 cm2, 1.5x1.5 cm2, 2x2 cm2

* Defects are uniformly distributed: A single defect on a chip results in a defective chip

* Note that a defect may not fall on a chip

*Cost to manufacture a single wafer: $5,000
